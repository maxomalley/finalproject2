        <h2>Financing</h2>
        
<p>At Pacific Promise, our mission to combat ocean pollution and promote sustainable marine conservation relies on diverse and strategic financing. Our approach combines innovative revenue models, partnerships, and community support to ensure that our initiatives are both impactful and sustainable</p>
<h5> Revenue Streams</h5>
<p> Pacific Promise offers advanced ocean-cleaning technologies, such as the SeaCycle Filtration Buoy and ReWave Cleanup Drone, designed to remove plastic waste efficiently. A portion of the revenue from these products directly funds research, development, and operational efforts to improve marine environments. <p>
<p> We collaborate with environmentally conscious corporations that share our vision. These partnerships involve sponsorships, co-branded initiatives, and contributions that fuel our mission while helping companies meet their sustainability goals.

</p>
<p>As a leader in marine conservation, Pacific Promise secures grants from governments and global environmental organizations. These funds support large-scale cleanup operations, innovative research projects, and community engagement programs.

</p>
<p>Our work is also made possible through the generosity of individuals and philanthropists. We run transparent donation campaigns and provide regular updates on how contributions are used to create measurable impacts.

</p>
<p> We license our proprietary technologies to organizations worldwide, enabling them to implement our systems locally. This creates a global impact while generating revenue to sustain our operations.
